![Building Search APIs with Hono.js](./img/hero.png)


Search is an integral part of our experience using the internet. Information consumption is fuelled by our ability to search, and do so efficiently. Search is more than just finding a needle in a haystack - it's about understanding user intent, context, and delivering relevant results instantly. The rise of AI and vector databases has transformed what's possible with search, making previously complex and inaccessible features like semantic understanding and generative responses accessible to developers.

In this tutorial, we'll build a versatile search API using Hono.js that implements three powerful search paradigms: Vector, Hybrid, and Generative search. You'll learn how these different search types work and when to use each one.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have:
- Node.js 18+ installed
- Basic understanding of JavaScript 
- Familiarity with REST APIs
- A package manager (npm or yarn)
- Basic understanding of vector databases (we'll use Weaviate)

> ❓ Don't know what a Vector Database is? Here is a great [explainer](https://weaviate.io/blog/what-is-a-vector-database#vector-database-vs-vector-store)!

## Why Hono.js?

You might be asking, "Why Hono.js??" 

Hono is a fast, lightweight web framework that's changing how we build APIs. Here's what makes it special...

It's built on [Web Standards](https://hono.dev/docs/concepts/web-standard) which doesn't just make it future proof but **runtime agnostic** too. This means it works everywhere JavaScript runs i.e. Deno, Bun, Node.js, and edge runtimes. This reliance on only Web standards makes it quicker than most runtimes because it has minimal overhead and ~ zero dependencies. 

With that, let's dive into search! 

## Understanding Modern Search Types

### Vector Search

Vector search, also referred to as semantic search goes beyond [exact matches](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/concepts/search/keyword-search) to understand the meaning behind queries. When you search for "affordable electric cars", it knows to include results about "budget-friendly EVs" even if those exact words aren't present.

Think of vectors as GPS coordinates for meaning - just like how two locations can be close on a map, two pieces of text can be close in meaning.

### Hybrid Search

Hybrid search gives you the best of both worlds - the precision of traditional keyword search with the understanding of vector search. It's like having a smart assistant who checks both exact matches and related concepts.

### Generative Search 

Generative search is where Generative AI really shines. Instead of just finding relevant content, it can create new, contextual responses based on the search results. Imagine asking not just "find documents about climate change" but "summarize the latest findings on climate change mitigation".

With our new knowledge, let's build some APIs!

## Building Search APIs

We're building a server application that exposes an API we can use to run the three searches we just learned about.

You can use the final [project repository](https://github.com/malgamves/weaviate-servers/tree/main/hono-server) as a reference should you need clarification as you go through the tutorial. 

### Step 1: Setup

Set up your Hono.js application with the following command.

```
npm create hono@latest my-app
```
You will be asked which template you would like to use. Select Node.js.
After your application is initialized, you should have a nice new Hono.js application.

### Step 2: Root routes

Using the Node.js template will create a file called `index.ts` in your `src` directory.

```js
// src/index.ts
import { serve } from '@hono/node-server'
import { Hono } from 'hono'

const app = new Hono()

app.get('/', (c) => {
  return c.text('Hello Hono!')
})

const port = 3000
console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`)

serve({
  fetch: app.fetch,
  port
})
```

This file sets up a simple Node.js server that you can interact with on `localhost:3000`. If we make a get request to `http://localhost:3000/` we will get a response from the server saying "Hello Hono". 

### Step 3: Setup Weaviate

We'll start by creating a free sandbox account on [Weaviate Cloud](https://console.weaviate.cloud/). Follow [this guide](https://weaviate.io/developers/wcs/connect) if you have trouble setting up a sandbox project.

You will need your Weaviate cluster URL and API key. If you don't already have one, you'll also need to create a Cohere [API key](https://dashboard.cohere.com/api-keys), we use Cohere as our [embedding model](https://weaviate.io/developers/academy/js/standalone/using-ml-models/embedding). When done, add all three to your `.env` file.

In your terminal, run the following commands to install the [weaviate-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/weaviate-client) and dotenv packages.

```bash
npm install weaviate-client dotenv
```

In your `config` folder, create a file called `weaviate.ts`. You can create the folder if it doesn't already exist. Paste the following code in it.

```ts
// config/weaviate.ts
import weaviate from 'weaviate-client';
import 'dotenv/config';

const weaviateURL = process.env.WEAVIATE_HOST_URL as string;
const weaviateKey = process.env.WEAVIATE_READ_KEY as string;
const cohereKey = process.env.COHERE_API_KEY as string;

export const connectToDB = async () => {
  try {
    const client = await weaviate.connectToWeaviateCloud(weaviateURL,{
          authCredentials: new weaviate.ApiKey(weaviateKey),
          headers: {
           'X-Cohere-Api-Key': cohereKey,
         }
        }
      )
      console.log(`We are connected! ${await client.isReady()}`);
      return client
  } catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof Error)
      console.error(`Error: ${error.message}`);
      process.exit(1);
  }
};
```

This code initializes a connection with Weaviate. 


### Step 4: Import some data

To get some data into your Weaviate instance, follow our [recipe on loading data](https://github.com/weaviate/recipes-ts/blob/main/similarity-search/cohere/load.ts) into Weaviate to import data to your Weaviate database.



### Step 5: Creating Search Routes
In `src`, create a folder called `search`. The files containing code for our search routes will go in there. 

#### Vector Search

Our first route will be for Vector search, create a file called `vector.ts` and paste the following code in it. 

```js
// src/search/vector.ts
import { Hono } from 'hono'
import { logger } from 'hono/logger'
import { cors } from 'hono/cors'
import { connectToDB } from '../../config/weaviate.ts';

const app = new Hono()
const client = await connectToDB();

// Middleware
app.use('*', logger())
app.use('*', cors())

app.get('/', async (c) => {
  const searchTerm = c.req.query("searchTerm");

  const wikipedia = client.collections.get("Wikipedia")

  if (searchTerm) {
    try {
      const response = await wikipedia.query.nearText(searchTerm, {
        limit: 5
      })

      return c.json(response)
    } catch (error) {
      if (error instanceof Error) {
        console.error(`Error: ${error.message}`);
        return c.json({
          error: error.message,
        })
      }
    }
  }
  return c.json({
    error: "Please add a query parameter to your request",
  })
})

export default app
```

In Weaviate, we use `query.nearText()` to make text Vector searches. Our `searchTerm` is whatever query comes in as query parameter. 

#### Hybrid Search

For our Hybrid search route, create a file called `hybrid.ts` and paste the following code in it.

```ts
// src/search/hybrid.ts
import { Hono } from 'hono'
import { logger } from 'hono/logger'
import { cors } from 'hono/cors'
import { connectToDB } from '../../config/weaviate.ts';

const app = new Hono()
const client = await connectToDB();

// Middleware
app.use('*', logger())
app.use('*', cors())

app.get('/', async (c) => {
  const searchTerm = c.req.query("searchTerm");

  const wikipedia = client.collections.get("Wikipedia")

  if (searchTerm) {
    try {
      const response = await wikipedia.query.hybrid(searchTerm, {
        limit: 5
      })

      return c.json(response)
    } catch (error) {
      if (error instanceof Error) {
        console.error(`Error: ${error.message}`);
        return c.json({
          error: error.message,
        })
      }
    }
  }
  return c.json({
    error: "Please add a query parameter to your request",
  })
})

export default app
```

In Weaviate, we use `query.hybrid()` to make hybrid searches. Our `searchTerm` is whatever query comes in as query parameter. 

#### Generative Search

For our Generative search route, create a file called `generate.ts` and paste the following code in it.


```ts
// src/search/generate.ts
import { Hono } from 'hono'
import { logger } from 'hono/logger'
import { cors } from 'hono/cors'
import { connectToDB } from '../../config/weaviate.ts';

const app = new Hono()
const client = await connectToDB();

// Middleware
app.use('*', logger())
app.use('*', cors())

app.get('/', async (c) => {
  const searchTerm = c.req.query("searchTerm");
  const prompt = c.req.query("prompt")

  const wikipedia = client.collections.get("Wikipedia")

  if (searchTerm) {
    try {
      const response = await wikipedia.generate.nearText(
        searchTerm, {
        groupedTask: prompt
      }, {
        limit: 5
      })

      return c.json(response)
    } catch (error) {
      if (error instanceof Error) {
        console.error(`Error: ${error.message}`);
        return c.json({
          error: error.message,
        })
      }
    }
  }
  return c.json({
    error: "Please add a query parameter to your request",
  })
})

export default app
```

In Weaviate, we use `generate.nearText()` to make generative searches. Our `searchTerm` is whatever query comes in as query parameter i.e the users search and `prompt` is a prompt we can either hardcode or have the user input. 

### Step 6: Putting it all together

We have to make the routes we create accessible from application.
To do that, paste the following into your `index.ts` file.

```js
// src/index.ts
// imports ...

import hybrid from './search/hybrid.ts'
import vector from './search/vector.ts'
import generate from './search/generate.ts'

// root route 
app.route('/search/hybrid', hybrid)
app.route('/search/vector', vector)
app.route('/search/generate', generate)

// server port etc ...
```

This creates three routes that make it possible to run these three very powerful searches from a single API. 

Start your server with `npm dev` and it's ready to test! 

## Step 7: Testing Your API

You can use tools like [Thunder Client](https://www.thunderclient.com/), [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), or [curl](https://curl.se/) to test your endpoints.

For this tutorial, we'll use curl. In your terminal run these commands.

```bash
# Test Vector search
curl "http://localhost:3000/search/vector?searchTerm=javascript"

# Test Hybrid search
curl "http://localhost:3000/search/hybrid?searchTerm=programming"

# Test Generative search
curl "http://localhost:3000/search/generate?searchTerm=AI&prompt=summarize"
```

With a quick, robust API now up and built, you can use this in whatever client side application you might need to. 

## Conclusion

You've now built a powerful search API that combines traditional search with modern AI capabilities.
