## Prerequisites

To use the Weaviate Agents and Weaviate Embedding service, you need to have a **[Weaviate Cloud](https://console.weaviate.cloud)** account.

## Step 1: Set up Weaviate

Now, let's get started by setting up a Weaviate Cloud instance that we will use for this tutorial and connecting it to the Python client.

### 1.1 Create a Weaviate Cloud cluster

1. Create a [free Sandbox cluster](/developers/wcs/manage-clusters/create#sandbox-clusters) in Weaviate Cloud.
1. Take note of the `REST Endpoint` and `Admin` API key to connect to your cluster. (for more info, check out the [quickstart](/developers/wcs/quickstart#22-connect-to-your-weaviate-cloud-instance))

:::tip
In this tutorial, we are using the [Weaviate Embeddings](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/model-providers/weaviate) service as the vectorizer, so you do not have to provide any extra keys for external embedding providers. Weaviate Embeddings uses the `Snowflake/snowflake-arctic-embed-l-v2.0` as the default embedding model.<br/><br/>
If you want to use another vectorizer, check out the list of supported [model providers](../../weaviate/model-providers/index.md).

### 1.2 Install the Python libraries

In order to install the Weaviate Python client together with the `agents` component, run:

```
pip install "weaviate-client[agents]"
```

You will also need `datasets`, a lightweight library providing access to the publicly hosted datasets on HuggingFace.

```
pip install datasets
```

### 1.3 Connect to your instance

Now, you can finally connect to your Weaviate Cloud instance with the parameters from the first step:

<Tabs groupId="languages">
  <TabItem value="py" label="Python Client v4">
    <FilteredTextBlock
      text={PyCode}
      startMarker="# START ConnectToWeaviate"
      endMarker="# END ConnectToWeaviate"
      language="py"
    />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

After running this snippet, you should see the message `True` printed out, which means that you have successfully connected to your instance.
